# MLCourse:Week7

Today we will cover,
- AutoEncoders
- GAN(Generative Adverserial Network)

and also discuss about,

- Overtraining
- Mitigating Overtraining using Early Stopping, Dropout layers
- Feature Importance in classification tasks, ranking of variables using Permutation Importance
- Multiclassifier

Please follow today's slides for details. This week we've provided the codes for basic GAN. You're welcome to try Autoencoder and Multiclassifier code yourself! Don't hesitate to ask help after you tried to implement them!

Today's folder has,
- LectureSlides: today's lecture
- basic_gan.py : basic GAN code for generating geometric shape, e.g. circle, functions($X^{3}$) etc.
