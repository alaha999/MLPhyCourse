## MLCourse:Week4

We have prepared two assignments on the advanced classification task based on research problems.
- ```Assignment 1:``` Classifying two standard model processes based on their properties (LHC CERN)
- ```Assignment 2:``` Classifying low or higher distance of Gravitational Wave source based on their properties(LIGO) [Many thanks Soorya for preparing this!]

Both are based on toy data made by us.

### Assignment 1
