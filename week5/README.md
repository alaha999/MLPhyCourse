# MLCourse:Week 5

### Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

### Task
Identifying high momentum tracks using CNN<br>
For details, please follow today's lecture.

In this folder, we have the following files,

- ```track_cnn.py```: script implementing CNN for training
- ```track_cnn_test.py```: script for testing the model on independent dataset
- ```LectureSlides```: Today's lecture on CNN

### Gdrive link to the input files
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4JNLlTFw_5Phawcowaz-WhPGpm2DgoA/view?usp=share_link
  
## Input Files
- filename: ```images.zip```
- It is a zip file. To unzip, execute this command from the terminal ```unzip <filepath>/images.zip```
- ```images``` folder have the following structure,

  - Training  
    - HiPt: containing high momentum tracks
    - LoPt: containing low momentum tracks
    
  - Testing
    - HiPt: containing high momentum tracks
    - LoPt: containing low momentum tracks


```
Not expecting you to implement this code. But, the code and the input data is here. If you feel like playing with the CNN, you are welcome. Just remember, its pretty resource intensive.
