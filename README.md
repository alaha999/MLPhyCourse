# ML Course IISER Pune

PH6232: Machine Learning and its physics applications

Course Website: https://alaha999.github.io/

Course Modules: https://alaha999.github.io/modules/

### Installing packages
We need ```python```,```numpy```,```matplotlib```,```tensorflow```,```keras```, and ```scikit-learn``` for this course.
- How to install scikit-learn: [install scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#installing-the-latest-release)
- How to install tensorflow: [install_tf_documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [pypi_pip](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/), [how-to-install-python-tensorflow-in-windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-tensorflow-in-windows/)
- How to install Keras: [install keras](https://pypi.org/project/keras/)

NB: Please make sure you have these libraries **working** in your system. If not, make sure you come to wednesday's tutorial session and we will help you with the installation! But this comes with a free joke,
