# ML course : Week3

This folder has,

- ```input/```: Input files for today's class
- ```ProjectileMotion_Classifier_Notebook.ipynb```: jupyter notebook for training the classifier
- ```proj_class.py```: python script of the same notebook
- ```ProjectileMotion_TestingNNModel_Notebook.ipynb```: jupyter notebook to evaluate or test the trained nn model
- ```proj_test_nn.py```: python script of the same notebook
- ```LectureSlides```: Today's lecture

### Input Files

If you look at the ```input/``` folder,

- Training file: projectile_input4_100k.txt (100000 examples)
- Testing file: projectile_input4_test_20k.txt (20000 examples)

### Task
- Train a neuron network model to classify between projectiles thrown at velocity between 25m/s - 35m/s or at any other velocity

- Once training is complete, evaluate the trained model using a statistically independent testing sample consists of 20000 examples
