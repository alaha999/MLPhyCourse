# ML course : Week 2  

This folder has,
 - ```input/``` : It has all the input files for today's class
 - ```ProjectileMotion_Regression_Notebook```: jupyter notebook demonstrating today's task
 - ```proj_regr.py```: python file of the same notebook 
 - ```README```      : Description of the input files


### Input Files

If you look at the ```input/``` folder,

1. Files with the following columns
   ```tof height distance vel angleDeg```
   generated with velocity random between 10 and 20, and angleDeg random
   between 30 and 50 degrees.
   - projectile_input_200.txt
   - projectile_input_test_10.txt
   - projectile_input_10000.txt
   - projectile_input_test_100.txt

2. Files with following columns
   ```tof height distance vel angleDeg```
   generated with velocity random between 10 and 50, and angleDeg random
   between 30 and 70 degrees.
   - projectile_input2_10000.txt
   - projectile_input2_test_100.txt

3. Files with following columns
   ```"tof height distance vel angleDeg"```
   generated with velocity random between 10 and 50, and angleDeg random
   between 30 and 70 degrees. In addition, the outputs tof, height and dist
   are smeared by an amount up or down (amount is between 5 and 15 %)
